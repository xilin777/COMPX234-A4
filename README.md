# COMPX234-A4

This repository contains the implementation of a client-server networked program using UDP for Assignment 4 of COMPX234.  
The project includes a multi-threaded server and a synchronous client to download files reliably over an unreliable channel.

## Initial Setup
- Created `UDPclient.py` and `UDPserver.py` as the main files.
- Next steps: Implement basic socket communication and file handling.

## Usage
- TBD
